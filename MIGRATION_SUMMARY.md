# Nutrition AI Agent - Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated and integrated all features from the old `nutrition_agent` directory into the new `agent` directory, creating a fully functional AI companion that evaluates nutrition data and provides personalized recommendations.

## What Was Done

### 1. New Architecture Created

**Files Created in `agent/` directory:**
- [models.py](agent/models.py) - Data models (Product, UserProfile, EvaluationResult)
- [barcode_service.py](agent/barcode_service.py) - Barcode lookup with API and mock data
- [evaluators.py](agent/evaluators.py) - Health, Fitness, and Price evaluators
- [nutrition_companion.py](agent/nutrition_companion.py) - Main AI companion with conversational behavior
- [service.py](agent/service.py) - Backend integration layer
- [agent.py](agent/agent.py) - Main entry point (updated)
- [__init__.py](agent/__init__.py) - Package initialization (updated)
- [demo.py](agent/demo.py) - Demo script
- [README.md](agent/README.md) - Comprehensive documentation

### 2. Technology Migration

**From (Old System):**
- Anthropic Claude API (via `anthropic` library)
- Multiple separate agent files
- Complex async architecture
- Manual LLM service management

**To (New System):**

## Architecture Benefits

### Modularity
```
agent/
â”œâ”€â”€ models.py              # Data structures
â”œâ”€â”€ barcode_service.py     # Product lookup
â”œâ”€â”€ evaluators.py          # Health, Fitness, Price logic
â”œâ”€â”€ nutrition_companion.py # AI orchestration
â””â”€â”€ service.py            # Backend integration
```

Each component is:
- Self-contained
- Easily testable
- Simple to extend
- Well-documented

### Extensibility

Adding new evaluators is simple:

```python
# In evaluators.py
class EnvironmentalEvaluator(BaseEvaluator):
    async def evaluate(self, product, user_profile):
        # Analyze carbon footprint, packaging, etc.
        pass

# In nutrition_companion.py
self.environmental_evaluator = EnvironmentalEvaluator()
# Add to evaluation pipeline
```

### Integration

The service layer provides clean integration:

```python
from agent import get_nutrition_agent_service, run_async

service = get_nutrition_agent_service()

# Synchronous wrapper for Flask
product = run_async(service.scan_barcode("722252601025"))
evaluation = run_async(service.evaluate_product(product, user_profile))
```

## Migration Advantages

## Usage Examples

### Scan and Evaluate

```python
import asyncio
from agent import get_companion
from agent.models import UserProfile

async def main():
    companion = get_companion()

    # Scan product
    product = await companion.scan_barcode("722252601025")

    # Create user profile
    profile = UserProfile(
        health_goals="low sugar, high protein",
        fitness_goals="muscle building",
        daily_protein_target_g=150
    )

    # Evaluate
    evaluation = await companion.evaluate_product(product, profile)

    print(f"Score: {evaluation['overall']['score']}/100")
    print(f"Message: {evaluation['companion_message']}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Backend Integration

```python
# In Flask routes
from agent import get_nutrition_agent_service, run_async

service = get_nutrition_agent_service()

@app.route('/api/barcode/scan', methods=['POST'])
def scan():
    barcode = request.json['barcode']
    product = run_async(service.scan_barcode(barcode))
    return jsonify(product)
```
